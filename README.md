## What is CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is a powerful tool that CSS gives us to easily align items and create two-dimensional layouts.

- Grid and Flexbos are both part of CSS and can both be used in similar ways.
- Flexbox was created first and has abit more browser compatibility.
- I would highly recommend learning both of them.

## Grid Containers & Grid Items

The Grid Container is the element that holds grid items.
Grid items are direct children of grid containers.A container is created with display: grid.

## Two Dimensional Layouts

Unlike Flexbox, which is one-dimensional and can be either a row or column, a CSS Grid allows us to create two-dimensional layouts with rows AND columns.
